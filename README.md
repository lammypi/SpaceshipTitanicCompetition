# SpaceshipTitanicCompetition

This repository is dedicated to my work in the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle. Here is the competition page for reference:

This is a knowledge-building competition, so neither points nor money are awarded for participation in it. I entered it in July 2022 as a way to reinforce my learnings on entropy/information gain-based methods such as random forests, XGBoost, and CatBoost, and also to compare their performance to distance-based methods like Logistic Regression.

Aside from choosing different classification methods, the major differences in my attempts centered around the feature engineering and the models I created from the feature sets. My very first attempts used basic models with very little feature engineering, which I used as a baseline to understand whether I was overfitting or underfitting the data.

__Summary of My Process__
1. Load and review data
2. Clean data
3. Variable exploration
4. Model building and finalization
5. Training and validation
6. Test predictions and competition submission
