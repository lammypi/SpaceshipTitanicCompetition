# SpaceshipTitanicCompetition

This repository is dedicated to my work in the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle.

The Spaceship Titanic Competition is a knowledge-building competition, so neither points nor money are awarded for participation in it. I entered it in July 2022 as a way to reinforce my learnings on entropy/information gain-based methods such as random forests, XGBoost, and CatBoost, and also to compare their performance to distance-based methods like Logistic Regression.

Aside from choosing different classification methods, the major differences in my attempts centered around the feature engineering and the models I created from the feature sets.
